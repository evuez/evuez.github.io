A nibble is 4 bits, a byte is usually 8 bits and Donald Knuth coined the word _wyde_ for 16 bits.

In [_The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1, Fascicle 1: ⅯⅯⅠⅩ_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/299643.The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Volume_1_Fascicle_1), Knuth also uses _tetrabyte_ and _octabyte_ for 32 and 64 bits:

 - 1 nibble = 4 bits
 - 1 byte = 2 nibbles
 - 1 wyde = 2 bytes
 - 1 tetrabyte = 2 wydes
 - 1 octabyte = 2 tetrabytes
