      <h1>Lock Out, Tag Out</h1>
      <p>A safety procedure used to ensure that a machine is properly shut off and can't unexpectedly energize.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.osha.gov/Publications/3120.html">OSHA</a>, the following steps must accomplished:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Prepare for shutdown;</li>
<li>Shut down the machine;</li>
<li>Disconnect or isolate the machine from the energy source(s);</li>
<li>Apply the lockout or tagout device(s) to the energy-isolating device(s);</li>
<li>Release, restrain, or otherwise render safe all potential hazardous stored or residual energy. If a possibility exists for reaccumulation of hazardous energy, regularly verify during the service and maintenance that such energy has not reaccumulated to hazardous levels; and</li>
<li>Verify the isolation and deenergization of the machine.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This can also be applied when two or more people are working on the same machine.
From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockout-tagout#Group_lockout">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When two or more people are working on the same or different parts of a larger overall system, there must be multiple holes to lock the device. To expand the number of available holes, the lockout device is secured with a folding scissors clamp that has many pairs of padlock holes capable of keeping it closed. Each worker applies their own padlock to the clamp. The locked-out machinery cannot be activated until all workers have removed their padlocks from the clamp.</p>
